        - The scaffold will create `_specs/<family>/<version>/assets/` with `diagrams/`, `images/`, and `attachments/`.
        - The Overview (`index.md`) starts as **in-progress** and includes `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
        - Sidebar order: Overview (0), HLD (10), LLD (20), Data Model (25), API (30), UX (40), Rollout & Ops (50), QA / Test Plan (60).
